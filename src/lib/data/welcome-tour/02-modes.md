## Modes

Penflow gives you three editing modes to work with:

- Edit
- Side-by-side editing
- Preview

In the side-by-side editing mode, you get to both preview and edit your notes at the same time.\
You can cycle between different modes using either the switcher in the top-right corner, or by
pressing the `Ctrl + E` keyboard shortcut (`Cmd + E` on Mac).
