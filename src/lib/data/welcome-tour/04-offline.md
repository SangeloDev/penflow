## Offline-First

Penflow works fully offline, once you've visited the webapp at least once!\
Penflow was built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and with offline-first principles in mind, ensuring that you can access your notes anywhere and at any time.

If Penflow gets a new release while you've been away, you'll be prompted to refresh the app, once you have a connection again.
