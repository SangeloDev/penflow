Welcome to [penflow.app](https://penflow.app)! It's nice having you around.\\
Penflow can display bog-standard markdown in a pretty, simple, distraction-free way to make sure that you can edit your documents quickly and efficiently.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this project is still in its infancy and can still change drastically. I do not consider this a rock-solid experience yet, but do give me any suggestions you might have. Thanks \\:)

### Use \`Ctrl + Shift + O\` or \`Cmd + Shift + O\` to start a new document!

And to view all possible keyboard shortcuts, press \`Ctrl + Alt + /\` or \`Cmd + Option + /\`

## Features

Penflow offers a simple feature-set to make sure you stay focused on editing and writing:

- Beautiful but minimal design
- Completely [open source](https://github.com/SangeloDev/penflow)!
- Extensive keyboard shortcuts
- Two ways to edit and preview your Markdown
- Resizable side-by-side panels
- Local-first, and completely offline (try it out!)
- Github-Flavored Markdown (tables, ~~strikethrough~~, emojis :rocket: and checkboxes)
